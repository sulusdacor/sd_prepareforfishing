	<description>"PrepareForFishing"
	
	Fix to use the mod Fishindustry with my bridges mod.
	
	This needs to be loaded after the [sd] bridges mod since it uses the terraform category created by bridges: 1. bridges 2. prepare for fishing
	
	Where you load fishindustry mod does not matter at all.
	
	- you can build fishfeeding box, select the watertile(shallow,deep,marsh), start and it convertes watertiles to vanilla terrain tiles (takes ~1day).
	- the fishfeeding box is in the terraforming menu
	- you can use this without fishindustry will not cause errors, but will not give you any benefit, other then converting tiles without a pawn doing activly the job of terraforming(just need to build the fishfeeder)
	
	Download links for Dropbox (current or older versions) or Steamworkshop link for current Rimworld version can be found in the ludeon forum thread linked above.</description>
