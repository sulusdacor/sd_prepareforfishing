	<description>"PrepareForFishing"
	Ver.: b18-1.1.0
	
	Originally this was a Fix to use the mod Fishindustry with my bridges mod.
	You can use it without it. This can fix the water effects if you terraform and wish to do so.
	
	It needs [sd] brdiges.
	
	- you can build fishfeeding box, select the watertile(deep, deep - ocean, deep - moving, shallow, shallow - ocean, shallow - moving, marsh), start and it convertes watertiles to vanilla terrain tiles (takes ~1day).
	- the fishfeeding box is in the terraforming menu
	- you can use this without fishindustry will not cause errors, but will not give you any benefit, other then converting tiles without a pawn doing activly the job of terraforming(just need to build the fishfeeder)
	
	Download links for Dropbox/GitHub (current or older versions) or Steamworkshop link for current Rimworld version can be found in the ludeon forum thread linked above.</description>
